Adaptive Cuckoo Filters
============
Adaptive Cuckoo Filter can exploit the skewed access pattern and dynamically adjust the size of a list of cuckoo filters to achieve smaller false positive rate than a single cuckoo filter.

This is the prototype and the fork of the original cuckoo filter implemented by Bin Fan.
